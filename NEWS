	- Updated package namespace to export and import variables
	- Changed depends to imports for edgeR and fdrtool
	- Fixed treatment output in function SimData
	- Removed algorithm from documentation for function SimData
	- Removed samp.col from output for function SimData
	- Changed treatment from 0 and 1 to non-tumor and tumor in kidney dataset

0.5.1: 2013-09-28: SimSeq version 0.5.1
	- fixed bug in samp.independent method in SimData function when samp.independent equal TRUE
	- updated documentation

0.5.0: 2013-09-14: SimSeq version 0.5.0
	- changed name of "offset" input to "norm.factors" in all functions
	- removed symmetric swapping functionally. As such n1.diff, n1.genes, and genes1.select are removed from all functions
	- Updated Documentation
	- Moved packages 'edgeR' and 'fdrtool's back to Depends field
	- updated demo file

	- Changed version names of all files from 1.x.y to 0.x.y 
	- removed pval.hist function
	- now calculates weights for sampling genes by local fdr through fdrtool function from CRAN package 'fdrtool'
	- changed name of EBP input in SimData function to weights
	- updated examples for SimData
	- updated documentation of functions
	- removed package 'edgeR' from Depends field in description file
	- added package 'edgeR' and 'fdrtool' to Suggests field in description file 

0.3.0: 2013-08-29: SimSeq Version 0.3.0
	- Moved wilcox signed rank and rank sum test out of SimData function to its own function, CalcPvalWilcox
	- Changed default for offsets to calcNormFactors from package 'edgeR' using method "TMM"
	- Created dependency on package 'edgeR'
	- Changed independence swapping code (changed method for adjusting data by offsets, eliminated for-loops)
	- Set samp.independent default to FALSE
	- Minimal cleaning up of help/documentation files (still needs a bit of work)
	- Created CalcPvalWilcox .Rd file

0.2.0: 2013-08-24: SimSeq Version 0.2.0
	- Substantially cleaned up code for readability and maintainability
	- Added more detailed comments to code
	- Renamed data.sim and sortdata functions to SimData and SortData respectively

	- help files are no longer working


0.0.0: 2013-08-17: SimSeq Version 0.0.0
	- Created sortdata, samp.col, and data.sim functions
	- sortdata: sorts matrix of gene express. data given vector of replicates and treatment
	- samp.col: samples replicates by columns separately and independently
	- data.sim: Now has functionality to simulate under both standard and independent method for both paired and unpaired data
